###Let and Const

#Let is new Var
Use for variable values,

#Const
Constant values, never change, const will never receive a new value



###Arrow Functions

#ES5
function myFnc() {
      ...
}

#ES6
const myFnc = () => {
      ...
}
No more issues with THIS keyword
THIS will always keep it's context, and not change/throw errors
